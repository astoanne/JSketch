Enhancement: Locate or draw images for a head, torso, upper and lower arm, hands, upper and lower leg, and feet. These don't need to be fancy or perfectly cut out. In fact, roughly cut-out photographic images, or hand-sketched components can have a pleasing aesthetic (10 marks).

To test scale on Mac, choose legs(assignement specification) then hold COMMAND while dragging with trackpad DOWN (or I believe in Windows, alt button while left clicking with your mouse). I didn't test this on a real device because I don't have one.
